# notice
Users can connect a phone when its scaned with wifiscanner or any other device which scans it... For now, this is ok, but there will be more features added in future releases. Users can also modify the image viewer to whatever you link in the it or just open the image. The image name will always be wifi.png, but you may have to re-remove the rm command which can be accomplished by editing the script.
